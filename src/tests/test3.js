// Instructions:
// Timmy (Tbone) Matthews got statues of different sizes as a present from DevMountain for his birthday,
// each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to
// arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly
// by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the
// minimum number of additional statues needed.

// Example
// For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
// makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3 (because Timmy needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7)

// statues will be an array of distinct positive integer
// statues.length will be greater than 1 but less than 11
// each statue will be greater than 0 but no greater than 20

// Expecting the function to return an integer

// The minimal number of statues that need to be added to existing statues such that it contains
// every integer size from an interval [L, R] (for some L, R) and no other sizes.
