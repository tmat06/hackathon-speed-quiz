This is not for the weak minded...

Each team will be given a set of coding questions. The goal is to
complete each question in the fastest amount of time while also being
the most bug proof code. Once each question is complete, the opposing
team will have a chance to debunk the code. If they're able to debunk
the code, the points will be awarded to them.
